### Hey, I'm Nick 🧑‍💻

I'm a chicago-based web developer and former logistics and shipping nerd (ask me about Owney the Unofficial Post Office Mascot). 

- Pronouns: He/Him
- I’m currently enrolled in Actualize Boot Camp learning Ruby on Rails and React.
- I love bicycling, horror movies (especially bad ones), comic books, Chicago, and have proudly been in the top 1% of Carly Rae Jepsen listeners for the last four years on Spotify.
